1. How do I fix this error:

can't get servo comm shm

You need to make the shared memory device. Run rtlib/SETUP or do this:

sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/rtai_shm c 10 254

Also do the FIFOs while you're at it:

for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ; do sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/rtf$n c 150 $n ; done

2. How do I fix this error:

insmod: error inserting '../rtlib/gomain_mod.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module

You need to run the RTAI modules. Do this: 

	bin/insrtl

It's normally part of the bin/run script.

3. How do I set up the Sensoray 626?

cd to drivers/s626-0.3 or a newer version and follow the README
instructions, probably something like this:

	make clean
	make
	make install
	make lib

You should end up with 'libs626.a', which is what the Go configure
script looks for when checking for Sensoray 626 support.

Then, 

sudo modprobe s626

4. How do I fix this error:

"Can't find a usable init.tcl in the following directories"

when running the Tcl/Tk pendant GUI?

Set the TCL_LIBRARY env var to point to where init.tcl is located, e.g., 

export TCL_LIBRARY=c:/cygwin/usr/share/tcl8.4

5. How do I fix this error:

shmget: Invalid argument

This means that shared memory from a previous run is still lying
around, and the size has changed for the new run. Run "ipc-clear" to
get rid of the previous shared memory.
