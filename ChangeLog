	between -pi and pi; externed some extra functions from genserkins;
	Changed go_screw to go_vel type; added go_body type for rigid

	script running button to pendant.tcl

1.21	11 August 2009
	Fixed a bug in genserkins.c inverse kinematics, where it didn't
	converge due to the incremental displacement pose not being in
	the base coordinate frame

1.20	7 August 2009
	Added ulapi_system; fixed bug in genserkins.c forward jacobian

1.19	5 June 2009
	Added go_point_plane_project, go_point_line_project,
	go_line_plane_project, go_cart_cart_par,perp

1.18	24 September 2008

	Added time-based joint moves; linking of user-supplied external
	interface code via --with-extintf

1.17	11 April 2008

	Fixed checking for active controllers by configuration and other
	programs, using heartbeats or NOP config requests.
	Added 'here' feature for setting the current Cartesian position.
	Handled varying numbers of active axes better.
	Added servo status 'enable' to flag when outputs can go out.
	Used nominal instead of actual joint values as reference for
	calculating the servo setpoint increment for teleoperation.
	Added [SERVO] HOWMANY to establish how many joints we have, and
	reworked the servo tasks, trajectory task, gomain, gosh, gotk and
	gorun to only run, configure and use the joints needed.
	Stopped overriding defaults in rtapi_arg_get_int,string.
	Added ext_galil.c and emu_galil.c to test external servos.
	Added tool transforms.
	Fixed go_mat_norm so that it normalizes any reasonable
	rotation matrix.
	Changed from igps.c, tracker.c to full igpserver,client.c.
	Fixed circular (spiral helical) motion so that it uses
	estimated (average radial) arc length as the interpolation
	parameter.

1.16:	7 December 2007

	Added socket functions to ulapi, and build igps.c with a socket
	interface to the indoor GPS.
	Ramped the joystick speed to limit acceleration.
	Added circular motion.

1.15:	3 October 2007

	Fixed bug in walk_in function for external Cartesian position
	referencing via 'Xinv'.

	Added simulated index pulse homing to stepper motor external
	interface.

	Added go_screw data type for velocity, and changed all the
	kinematics code accordingly.

1.14:	18 September 2007

	Added tracker application and traj_ref_struct for tracking of
	external Cartesian position measurements. 

	Changed default timeout in gotk to forever. Scripts now work more
	intuitively without calling gotk_set_timeout forever explicitly.
	Added Stop button to pendant GUI.

1.10-13:
	31 May 2007

	Added gotk_traj_hold to hold position upon startup.
	Reworked kinematics and units, adding general serial kinematics. 
	Added matrix and vector types to gomath to support Jacobians.

1.9:	18 December 2006

	Stable system tested on winch-driven cable robot.

1.8:	An intermediate build.

1.7:
	18 August 2006

	Added walked-in speed scaling.
	Added time-based world and joint moves.
	Took out CJ, CA motion profile types and just used CJ.

1.6:	16 June 2006

	Added go_motion_queue_set_scale for speed scaling, aka
	feed override, but it just sets a scale factor immediately
	and the testing/testscale script shows that the jerk jumps
	unboundedly so we need to "walk in" the scaling.

1.5:	12 June 2006

	Added support for Linux 2.6, including:
	No anonymous unions, using .u and .v instead;
	Changes to rtlib/Makefile,SETUP for 2.4 kernel module compile

1.4:	9 June 2006

	Added gohal.c, which sets up base timer period.

1.1-1.3:
	Baseline system under development.
