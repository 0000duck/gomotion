This is the Windows implementation of Go Motion.

To build, open 'win32api.sln' in Microsoft Visual C++. The project was
set up with VC++ Express 2010 and may be converted by more recent VC++
versions. 

Do a "Build" in VC++. The executables end up in the Debug folder. 

Open a command prompt and try this first: 

   cd Debug
   gokintest -i ..\..\etc\genhex.ini

This will bring up the Go Motion kinematics tester with the .ini file
of a Stewart Platform hexapod machine. You will see the cable lengths
and position displayed.

Type:

   i

to go into inverse kinematics mode, then

   0 0 -110 0 0 0

to show the cable lengths at 110 units down. 

To run a full controller, run the 'gorun.bat' file.
To run the graphical pendant, you need to get ActiveTcl and install it. 
Put C:\Tcl\bin in your path.

To run scripts, do this: 

cd Debug
gotk.exe ..\..\scripts\raster.tcl -- -i ..\..\etc\genhex.ini
